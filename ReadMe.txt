Hello CellRanger users!

Here you can use various pipelines of 10x genomics.

Hopefully we will set an infrastracture that will make those pipelines more accessable 
and also new algorithems which are not included in 10x genomics.

The API should contain:

1) Converting BCL to Fastqs
2) Count pipelines
3) Multiplexing
4) Demultiplexing 
5) Quality checks
6) Dealing with various samples: GEX, VDJ, Antibodies etc.
7) TSNE & UMAP presentations
8) Optional: Preprocessing algorithems


All you need to do:

1) Fill out the config file in the const_files folder
2) Fill out the program.csv file in the const_files folder

Note: 
Format of the program.csv file will be determined as soon as possible
